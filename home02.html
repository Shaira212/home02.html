<h1><p><i>White Americans are decidedly more punitive than African Americans or Hispanics. Sixty-three percent of  White support the death penalty, as compared to only thirty-six percent of African Americans and forty percent of Hispanics. Whites are also more supportive of other harsh measures, including trying juveniles as adults and the "three-strikes" law. Blacks, by contrast, are substantially more likely to support public investment in education and job training as a crime prevention measure.</i></p></h1>

<h2><p><i><u>What explains whites preference for harsh criminal laws?</u> Crime victims understandably might favor more punitive responses. But whites are considerably less likely to be victims of crime, especially violent crime: African-Americans are six times more likely than whites to die of homicide. Crime has always been a more serious problem in areas of concentrated urban poverty, and blacks more often live in such neighborhoods. Yet despite their substantially lower vulnerability to crime, whites are more likely than blacks to support punitive crime policies.</i></p></h2>

<h2><p><i>Blacks and Hispanics do commit certain crimes more frequently, per capita, than whites, but not all. But whites consistently overestimate the difference, according to one study, by as much as twenty to thirty percent. That perception affects attitudes toward offenders and sentencing. Studies show that the more whites attribute higher crime rates to blacks and Hispanics, the more likely they are to support harsh criminal laws.This is a damning indictment. If anyone were to admit that they preferred the death penalty, life without parole, or harsh sentences because they believe the perpetrators of violent crimes are more likely to be black or Hispanic, we would immediately condemn them as the worst sort of racist. If a prosecutor, judge, or juror expressed such a sentiment, any resulting conviction or sentence would be swiftly overturned. No one admits that they feel this way, but the studies recounted by the Sentencing Project suggest that this is precisely what many white Americans feel.</i></h2></p>
